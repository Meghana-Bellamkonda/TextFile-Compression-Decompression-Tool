# TextFile-Compression-Decompression-Tool
This undertaking relies on Huffman Coding, an effective compression algorithm that preserves data integrity and operates in a hierarchical manner. It possesses the capability to compress and decompress text files while maintaining their original content.

The project involves the implementation of two main operations:

Encoding: It reduces the size of the given input file by compressing it.

Decoding: It restores the original file from a Huffman-coded file by decompressing it.
